  "review_full_text": "My girlfriend and I spent a week in Key West and chose this place to stay at which was an amazing decision, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful! The rooms were clean and comfy. And they have shuttles to take into the heart of town which is convenient. Would definitely recommend and would stay here again.",

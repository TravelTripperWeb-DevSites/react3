  "review_full_text": "We just left this hotel for a girls trip. The hotel itself was beautiful and clean. The pool was perfect and the Toasted Coconut had amazing food and drinks. We weren’t really expecting the food to be as good as it was for a little poolside restaurant/bar. The plantain French toast was so good! The best part of the hotel was the staff! EVERYONE we encountered was just phenomenal! Chris at the front desk was welcoming and helped us out tremendously at check in. Vlad, at the toasted coconut was very friendly and provided great service! Roberta, the concierge gave us great info on excursions and booked us a great day trip. We got fresh towels and linens daily. The shuttle service was very convenient and the drivers were very friendly! Overall, we are all overly satisfied with this hotel. We would not hesitate to return and recommend to everyone!",

The whimsical spot has its own character &mdash; cats and chickens freely roam the premises, which was once home to Friday night boxing matches refereed by <a title=\"Ernest Hemingway museum\" href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/attractions/ernest-hemingway/\">Ernest Hemingway</a>. Blue Heaven has made a name for itself in the historic Bahama Village, but it&rsquo;s worth the wait &mdash; which is to be expected. Their southern Caribbean fare also features full-flavored <strong>lobster grits</strong> if you don&rsquo;t make it there in time for breakfast.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re jonesing for a real, New England style kind of seafood fix, check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/DJ's+Clam+Shack/@24.5540139,-81.8035267,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d1b6e9cfe20d3d:0xac425b720ad7349d!8m2!3d24.554009!4d-81.801338?hl=en\">DJ&rsquo;s Clam Shack</a></strong> on Duval Street. Reminiscent of Maine roadside stands serving up lobsters, fried clams and chips, DJ&rsquo;s has a wicked <strong>lobster roll</strong> served with coleslaw. The lobster roll has the good stuff too &mdash; filled with whole pieces of claw meat on a simple roll.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re strolling along the old docks of Port Bight, get a quick bite at <a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/Fisherman's+Cafe/@24.5606824,-81.8024173,21z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d1b6eaebcfce2b:0x5cc8c314a55ff535!8m2!3d24.5606032!4d-81.8022353?hl=en\"><strong>Fisherman&rsquo;s Cafe</strong></a>, which features <strong>lobster tacos enchilau</strong> made from Florida lobsters.

The fresh lobster meat is served on challah bread with melty cheesy goodness. For $2 extra you can compliment it with bacon and jalapeno, which we heartily recommend. The Lobster Shack also serves up a mean <strong>lobster bisque</strong>, as well as the <strong>Key Lime Lobster Roll</strong>, with lobster cooked in butter, tossed with key lime juice and special herbs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/Grunts+Bar/@24.5578265,-81.8075952,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d1b6ebf2f55393:0x5a7dc056a1c05c28!8m2!3d24.5578216!4d-81.8054065?hl=en\"><strong>Grunt&rsquo;s Bar</strong></a> is one of our favorite hidden treasures right off of <a title=\"Duval Street in Key West\" href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/attractions/duval-street/\">Duval Street</a>. While simple decor may fool you, Grunt&rsquo;s has a great fare and its <strong>lobster mac-n-cheese</strong> is like no other. You&rsquo;ll eat the plate if you aren&rsquo;t careful.

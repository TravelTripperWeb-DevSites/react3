Its peculiar history is exhibited in local museums, from shipwreck treasures to remnants of old Cuban cigar factories. It was home to the late American author Ernest Hemingway, whose old house on Whitehead Street has been converted into a museum that&rsquo;s occupied by 50-plus six-toed cats <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/keywest-florida-hemingway-house-cats/\">(more on the cats here)</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It&rsquo;s also home to a Civil War-era <a href=\"http://www.fortzacharytaylor.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fort Zachary Taylor</a>, located on the western end of the island. You can hike trails in the state park, tour the fort, snorkel the nearby waters, and see if you can spot iguanas sunning themselves.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Aside from its history, Key West has views for days &ndash; of the Caribbean Sea and Florida Straits. Lay out on the sandy shore of <a href=\"https://www.cityofkeywest-fl.gov/egov/apps/locations/facilities.egov?view=detail&amp;id=24\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Smathers Beach</a>, where you can <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/jet-ski-rental-requirements-key-west/\">rent a jet ski or another PWC</a> to explore the island&rsquo;s surrounding waters.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let's not forget one of Key West&rsquo;s main attractions: its wild nightlife. Duval Street is home to a variety of bars that entertain guests with live music, drag queen shows, and drink specials. There&rsquo;s never a dull moment on Duval Street, and annual festivals bring in lively parades and unforgettable street parties.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So, Florida residents, what are you waiting for?

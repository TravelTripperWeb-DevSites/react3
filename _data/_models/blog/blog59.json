  "more_content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">There are endless reasons to make Key West your vacation destination. We have beaches, mangroves, sunsets and sand. Another draw is the history of the island, from 6-toed Hemingway cats to President Truman&rsquo;s Little White House. There&rsquo;s Bahamian and Cuban influence, Spanish history and lots more that makes Key West so unique.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While all the perks of KW are obvious, we want to list the reasons why choosing 24 North as your place in paradise is the best option.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1. The pool</strong>.</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mornings or evenings poolside are the essence of relaxation -- with comfortable chairs set up for guests to lounge in the shade or get some sun. Our crystal-clear pool gives you the refreshing dip you need to get in that vacation state of mind.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2. Dine &amp; drink</strong>.</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Duval Crawl, beaches and museums are all alluring, but sometimes you just want to relax in your own backyard. At 24 North, you don&rsquo;t have to wander to get the essentials. With Starbucks on site, your morning joe is covered. If you&rsquo;re relaxing poolside, the Toasted Coconut has all your drink needs met, as well as a food. Within steps is <a href=\"https://www.gateshotelkeywest.com/eat-drink/\">The Blind Pig food truck</a>, which is permanently parked at our sister hotel, The Gates. 24 North offers tasty options beyond the typical pizza delivered to your hotel room.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3. Old Town Shuttle</strong>.</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Taxi rides with trips to Mallory Square start at about $20+, so there&rsquo;s no greater convenience than our Old Town Shuttle. With hourly trips to Mallory Square, you don&rsquo;t have to shell out so much to go out. Want to plan ahead? Check out the Old Town Shuttle schedule <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/shuttle/#schedule\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4. Fitness Center</strong>.</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With a fitness center on site, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about breaking your fitness plans while on vacation. Our fitness center has full outside views, top-of-the-line equipment and you can cool off in the pool afterward.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Ready to book at 24 North?

Here are 5 reasons Key West is one of the most laid-back vacation destinations in the country.</p>\n<h4>1. Breakfast happy hour is a thing</h4>\n<p>Whether you're partaking in the old drinker's adage, \"hair of the dog,\" or you're just having a mimosa to go with your breakfast meal, morning happy hour can be found at a few spots around Key West. Bagatelle (115 Duval St.) is a popular spot for brunch and drinks during the morning hours. If you're near the Key West Bight, you can also grab breakfast and a bloody mary at Schooner's Wharf (202 William St.), with a morning happy hour that runs from 7am to noon.</p>\n<h4>2. The maximum speed limit is 35 mph</h4>\n<p>You read that right. The speed limit on Key West maxes out at 35mph, making golf carts and scooters street legal. Get around the island by <a href=\"https://www.gateshotelkeywest.com/blog/scooter-ecar-golf-cart-rental-key-west/\">renting a golf cart</a> or enjoy a leisurely <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/bike-key-west-with-24-north/\">bike ride</a> around town &ndash; it may be the most easy-going ride you take all year.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>3. Chickens and roosters are typical pedestrians</h4>\n<p>Roosters and chickens can be seen living the good life all around the island. Key West's laissez-faire attitude of the chicks is 50 years in the making, when roosters were released after sport fighting became illegal.</p>\n<h4>4. Almost all restaurants offer outdoor dining</h4>\n<p>For an unrushed, relaxed meal or drink, outside spots are plentiful in Key West. You can sit streetside at a place like Moondog Cafe and enjoy the scene of Whitehead Street; or choose from spots on the Key West Bight for a view of the marina, from scrappy oyster bars to an upscale lobster house.</p>\n<h4>5. The sunset is celebrated every evening</h4>\n<p>The Key West sunset is relished every single day. Hundreds gather in Mallory Square every evening to watch the sun go down over the water. The experience is a humble start to an evening out on Duval Street, where just about anything goes.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Intrigued? Go ahead, book your stay on the best island in the US.

  "more_content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">24 North Hotel is situated right in New Town, a short drive from busy Duval Street, the crowds at Mallory Square and the rocky beach of Ft. Zachary. While New Town is more a place of locals, tourists should also enjoy what this part of the island has to offer. Here&rsquo;s the three reasons why New Town is a great place to stay while in Key West.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Good Eats</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Have you had your fill of Duval Street? If you want a laid-back evening with a local vibe, New Town has some great watering holes and eateries to enjoy. Check out <a href=\"https://www.kennedycafekeywest.com/\">Kennedy Cafe</a> at 924 Kennedy Drive for the best Mediterranean, Italian, Greek Turkish AND Uzbek food in Key West. Also on our list for a fantastic breakfast before you head out for the day is <strong>Goldman&rsquo;s Bagel Deli</strong> located at 2796 N Roosevelt Blvd., and the <strong>Key Plaza Creperie</strong> for a killer brunch. And, a Smather&rsquo;s Beach favorite is the food truck with the best view of the island, <strong>Leila&rsquo;s Latin Food</strong> for some authentic latino flavors.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Smather&rsquo;s Beach</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ask anyone: Smather&rsquo;s is the best beach on the island. Smather&rsquo;s Beach is sandy and not rocky like the beaches further south.The views are breathtaking and you can easily spend the whole day away from the noise. Smather&rsquo;s is located less than three miles from 24 North. Also, check out Sunset Watersports, where you can rent out paddle boats, catamarans, beach chairs, umbrellas and more at a reasonable price. <a href=\"http://www.sunsetwatersports.net/key-west-smathers-beach.html\">Visit their website here</a>.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Laid-back atmosphere</h3>\n<p>New Town is regarded as a local refuge from the noise of Old Town, and if you find yourself needing a walk through nature, New Town has hidden preserves of multiple ecosystems all within a small area. For real Florida habitat, check out the <a href=\"http://floridakeysaudubonsociety.tumblr.com/post/98553369941/the-fran-ford-white-crowned-pigeon-preserve-is\">Fran Ford White-crowned Pigeon Preserve</a>, which is a favorite for bird watchers. Also, <a href=\"http://floridahikes.com/little-hamaca-park\">Little Hamaca</a> is 10 acres of salt ponds and more, which also preserves 4 ecosystems that are unique to Florida. Also, if you want to really take it easy, enjoy a drink poolside and leave the rest up to us. We have a <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/dine-drink/starbucks/\">Starbucks on site</a>, as well as bar and restaurant <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/dine-drink/toasted-coconut/\">Toasted Coconut</a>.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p><em>Ready to book your stay?

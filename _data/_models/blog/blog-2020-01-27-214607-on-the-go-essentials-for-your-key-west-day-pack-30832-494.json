Don&rsquo;t forget these essential on-the-go items to bring on any outing in <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/\">Key West</a>.</p>\n<h4>Sun protection</h4>\n<p>Key West sees an average of 260 days of sunshine every year. This little detail should never be an afterthought! Make sure you have a small container of sunscreen to bring along with you, so if you forgot to put it on before leaving the hotel, you&rsquo;re all set. Plus, reapplying sunscreen is key to avoiding a sunburn. Sunglasses that block UV rays will also serve you well, as you&rsquo;ll notice the glare of the afternoon sun can make your eyes tired.</p>\n<h4>Hat</h4>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t forget the hat! It keeps the sun from beating down on your head and face. If you do manage to leave your designated beach hat at home, go all-out with a Panama hat from <a href=\"http://www.larubiakeywest.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">La Rubia Authentic Panama Hat</a>s at 510 Fleming St., or at the Key West Mad Hatter near <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/mallory-square/\">Mallory Square</a> at 253 Front St.</p>\n<h4>Blister pads&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Old Town Key West is so interesting, most visitors can&rsquo;t sit still for too long. You&rsquo;ll walk all over town, and this can cause blisters, no matter what pair of shoes you bring. Bring blister pads just in case, and consider using a <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/bike-key-west-with-24-north/\">bike around</a> town so you don&rsquo;t wear your feet out.</p>\n<h4>Cold water</h4>\n<p>Staying hydrated is key, but cool water during a hot day can really improve your mood. Bring an insulated thermos to make sure you always have water on-hand and that's pleasantly refreshing.</p>\n<h4>Cell phone power bank</h4>\n<p>No one wants to spend their vacation plugged into a restaurant wall while desperately waiting for their phone to charge. Because your phone is your camera, video camera, map, and point of contact, you&rsquo;ll want to bring along a lightweight power bank as back-up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img id=\"1580161375029\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1571724002/tqms849kq6jiq81hzyew.jpg\" alt=\"North Hotel Room\" width=\"601\" height=\"334\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1571724002/tqms849kq6jiq81hzyew.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1571724002/tqms849kq6jiq81hzyew.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1571724002/tqms849kq6jiq81hzyew.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1571724002/tqms849kq6jiq81hzyew.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1571724002/tqms849kq6jiq81hzyew.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Planning a stay in Key West?

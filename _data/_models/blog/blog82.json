This casual spot isn&rsquo;t as large as other bars on Duval Street and its outdoor seats on the patio are the best for people watching. The Rum Bar specializes in cocktails. Go for the Pain Killer, a tasty mix of rum, cream of coconut and pineapple that works well as hair of the dog. <em>1117 Duval Street</em></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://sloppyjoes.com/\">Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A Key West institution, tradition and island staple. Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s (officially) opened the day Prohibition was repealed by boat captain &ldquo;Sloppy&rdquo; Joe Russell. Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s bar is a Duval Street must. It&rsquo;s always busy, efficiently managed and teeming with energy.

Originally opened as a grocery store in 1890, it saw Cuban and Bahamian transplants that often would hang out and play music in the back room. Today it&rsquo;s a place for everybody with live music, open til 4 a.m. If you&rsquo;re looking for a real Key West dive bar, grab a drink at the Green Parrot. <em>601 Whitehead Street</em></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://oldcustomshouse.com/smallest-bar.html\">The Smallest Bar in Key West</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With all the bigger-than-life bars and activities in Key West, it&rsquo;s only customary to visit the smallest bar in Key West. This 72-square foot watering hole lives up to its name. Rumor has it that they have the best rum runners on the island. Order at the tiny bar and enjoy your rum runner outside and people watch -- there&rsquo;s almost always something to see. <em>124 Duval Street</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Planning a stay in Key West? <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/specials/\">Check out deals at 24 North Hotel.</a></em></p>",

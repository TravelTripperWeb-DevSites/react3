  "more_content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Key West is located at the end of U.S. Highway 1 &ndash; or the beginning, depending on how you look at it. The Key West Airport is an increasingly viable option for <a href=\"https://www.gateshotelkeywest.com/blog/all-routes-direct-flights-key-west-airport/\">many</a>, but have you considered arriving by sea? The <a href=\"https://www.keywestexpress.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Key West Express</a> in southwest Florida may be an option for you!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://www.keywestexpress.net/prepare-and-go\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Key West Express</a> is a fun, relaxing way to reach the southernmost island of the Florida Keys. It drops your off at the edge of Harbor Walk, right near <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/mallory-square/\">Mallory Square</a> and all the action of <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/duval-street/\">Duval Street.</a> It embarks from Fort Myers Beach and Marco Island at least five days a week, offering nonstop ferry service to Key West in roughly 3.5-4 hours.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The express boat includes air-conditioned interiors, exterior sun decks and plenty of seating options. Kick back on a couch, stake out a high-top table for your group, or take a power nap in the available reclining, airplane-style seats.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A galley for typical food, a full-service bar and flat-screen satellite televisions offer extra comfort to your ride.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before you ask, Wi-Fi is not available on the Key West Express. Look at it as a time to disconnect and really enjoy the experience. Take in the turquoise waters of the Keys, look for dolphins, and breathe in the fresh air!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Key West Express is merely a transportation service, so you can decide how to use it - whether you&rsquo;re making a quick jaunt to the Conch Republic or an extended stay.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Luggage is limited to two carry-on sized pieces per person, which should be more than enough for any stay in KW. Bicycles and pets are permitted aboard with a fee.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fare prices start at $95 for a one-way and $129 round-trip. Weekday travel and advanced ticket purchase will get you the most bang for your buck.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Parking is provided for passengers embarking from Marco Island. Passengers from Fort Myers have uncovered parking available for $14 a day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1576160474636\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1570769066/z1t7rvlvdgd5uqsdrzon.jpg\" alt=\"Room\" width=\"601\" height=\"334\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1570769066/z1t7rvlvdgd5uqsdrzon.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1570769066/z1t7rvlvdgd5uqsdrzon.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1570769066/z1t7rvlvdgd5uqsdrzon.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1570769066/z1t7rvlvdgd5uqsdrzon.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1570769066/z1t7rvlvdgd5uqsdrzon.jpg\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Key West is not just one thing. It&rsquo;s a sleepy fishing village that&rsquo;s also a popular stop to cruise ships; a place with seafood shacks steps away from upscale, Carribean fusion fare. There&rsquo;s something for everyone in Key West, which is why it attracts people from across the globe. Enjoy <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/specials/\">specials at 24 North</a>, your best option on the island. Clean rooms, a large pool area, Starbucks and other amenities make us a popular choice.</p>",

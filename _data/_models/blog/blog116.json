That&rsquo;s why we invite you to ensure your spot at <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/\">24 North Hotel Key West</a>, which offers shuttle services, activities at our Sunset Green Event Lawn, food at the Toasted Coconut, bar amenities, clean, well-kept rooms and pool access. If you&rsquo;re looking to enjoy Fantasy Fest but you also want a refuge from Old Town during your stay, choose <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/\">24 North</a>. Check out our best available rates, available only on our website.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the event usually centers around adult themes, there are also family-friendly events. One of the most popular is the Bahama Village Goombay Festival, which features live music, food vendors, dancing and more. This year&rsquo;s event lasts Oct. 19-20, with the outside concert stage located on the corner of Petronia and Fort Street.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Zombie bike ride and Heroes &amp; Villains 5k is for costumed participants and fun for the whole family.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If this is an adult fare, there&rsquo;s no shortage of events. As for costume parties alone, TuTu Tuesday is back for its ninth year, and a plaid party, tighty whitey party and lingerie party are a few of many planned events for adults. Want to get active? A Naughty Bike Ride is also in the works for this year&rsquo;s Fantasy Fest.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whatever your interest, the Bud Light Fantasy Fest Parade is the biggest event of the week, drawing thousands to Duval Street. If you&rsquo;re looking to have some distance from the crowds, buy your balcony seat ahead of time to get a heads-up on the event. Bourbon Bar is a popular spot -- but buy your tickets ahead of time, which will be available at keystix.com. These tickets sell out quickly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">---</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Booking a trip to Key West? <a href=\"https://www.gateshotelkeywest.com\">Check out rates at The Gates Hotel</a></em></p>",

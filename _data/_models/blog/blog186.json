The educational parrot sanctuary not far from <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/duval-street/\">Duval Street</a> is run by Nancy Forrester, who has been dedicated to rescuing and rehoming abandoned parrots for over 30 years.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Visitors who arrive at 10 am will likely get a chance to sit with the longtime Key West resident, who is also an ordained minister, artist, and environmental activist. Forrester educates visitors about the challenges that face the extraordinarily intelligent birds, many of which are purchased as exotic pets and later abandoned.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Forrester&rsquo;s birds are all bursting with character and idiosyncrasies, which makes the sanctuary all the more relevant. The intelligent, colorful species require stimulation and socialization to live happy lives - this is apparent in resident cockatoo Mr. Peaches, who is infatuated with smartphones and is always interested in a Facetime call!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A visit to Nancy Forrester&rsquo;s Secret Garden requires a $10 admission, which helps the parrot rescue afford to continue their work.

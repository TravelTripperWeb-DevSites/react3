  "more_content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Key West can be a tropical sin city of rum runners, fried conchs and key lime pie, but you can also reel back with healthy eating on the island. If there&rsquo;s time for a late-night treat after the Duval Crawl, then there&rsquo;s no reason you can&rsquo;t mix in some local or organic eats as well. Here&rsquo;s your organic/local food guide to Key West.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Date &amp; Thyme</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This natural foods market and organic cafe on the island has expanded in recent years. Date &amp; Thyme has outdoor seating in its cafe, open 8-4 p.m. The cafe features salads, sandwiches, wraps, bowls, burritos and more, with breakfast and smoothie options as well as organic coffee. The market and juice bar is open until 6 p.m. Try the indian summer salad if you&rsquo;re jonesing for a full-flavored plate. <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/Date+and+Thyme+Organic+Cafe+%26+Market/@24.5589821,-81.8006574,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d1b6c1adfe72d9:0x5f19c563e96f51b6!8m2!3d24.5589821!4d-81.7984687?hl=en\">829 Fleming St., Old Town</a></em></p>\n<h4>Sugar Apple Organic Cafe &amp; Market</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This grocery store and caf&eacute; is open from 10-6 for all your organic shopping needs. It&rsquo;s a quaint little stop but packs a lot of flavor in their food. It&rsquo;s a vegan favorite on the island. At the caf&eacute;, we recommend you try the Tempeh BLT, or the tasty Veggie Reuben sandwich. Grab food to go, as seating is very limited in the cafe. <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/Sugar+Apple+Organic+Restaurant,+Cafe+%26+Market/@24.5546057,-81.8028578,15z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1s917+Simonton+St.,+Old+Town!3m4!1s0x0:0x6173c342a56659e1!8m2!3d24.5523418!4d-81.7980596?hl=en\">917 Simonton St., Old Town</a></em></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Seven Fish</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Off the beaten path, Seven Fish is popular for serving up local seafood in an unpretentious manner. Try the 7-Fish Meatloaf to get a taste of local cuisine. Seven Fish is open for dinners from 6-10 p.m., closed Tuesdays. The New York Times reviewed the restaurant and said the food is so fresh and in high-demand, it&rsquo;s a good idea to make a reservation ahead of time. <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/Seven+Fish/@24.554606,-81.7962917,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d1b6c3aa2b2f83:0x3f826077f5cd4093!8m2!3d24.554606!4d-81.794103?hl=en\">921 Truman Ave., Old Town</a></em></p>\n<h4>Blue Heaven</h4>\n<p>Blue Heaven has made a name for itself because of its local, fresh, organic ingredients and tasty Caribbean-inspired fare. The whimsical spot was once home to Friday night boxing matches refereed by Ernest Hemingway. Today, it&rsquo;s one of the most popular, tried-and-true restaurants on the island, with roosters and cats roaming freely on the grounds. Go for breakfast or brunch and choose from healthy fare to eggs benedict. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed. <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/Blue+Heaven/@24.5516639,-81.8049877,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d1b6e866ed627f:0xd290f02bf9d29519!8m2!3d24.551659!4d-81.802799?hl=en\">729 Thomas St., Bahama Village</a></em></p>",

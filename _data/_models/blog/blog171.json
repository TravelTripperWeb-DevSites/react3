Simply enough, the term was derived from &ldquo;cayo,&rdquo; the Spanish word for &ldquo;little island.&rdquo; Since the Spanish arrived, the name (or a variation thereof) has stuck.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Roughly 1,700 small islands make up the Florida Keys, most of which are uninhabited by humans. Oftentimes, sandbars form near these little islands, offering an impromptu beach of sorts.

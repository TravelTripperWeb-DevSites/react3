Of course, evening plans will be a bit different if you&rsquo;re traveling with kids. Here&rsquo;s a look at a few family-friendly events for New Year&rsquo;s Eve.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Watch the Annual Dachshund Walk</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Described as a &ldquo;wiener wonderland,&rdquo; watch as up to 200 (mostly costumed) dachshunds strut along Fleming Street between Whitehead and Duval streets. It&rsquo;s an annual tradition that is bound to put everyone in a good mood. Starts at noon, see <a href=\"http://facebook.com/Key-West-Dachshund-Walk-161327957238019/.\">event page</a> for more.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Reserve a Sunset Cruise</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Book a cruise to watch the year&rsquo;s last sunset. All ages enjoy time out on the water, and it offers everyone a moment to reflect on the past year. <a href=\"https://www.furycat.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fury Water Adventures</a> offers a range of options, from glass-bottom boats to a sunset cruise with live music. See your <a href=\"https://www.furycat.com/key-west/new-years-eve\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">options</a> and don&rsquo;t hesitate to book ahead &ndash; tickets go fast.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Celebrate the Final Sunset at Mallory Square</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We take our sunsets in the Conch Republic <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/key-weird-sunsets-green-flash/\">pretty seriously,</a> and New Year&rsquo;s Eve is even more cause for celebration. Performers will pull out all their best tricks before and after sunset to commemorate the final sunset of the year. Arrive 45 minutes ahead of sunset to enjoy a drink at the bar at <a href=\"https://www.elmesondepepe.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">El Meson de Pepe</a>, let the kids take in the scene and check out the vendors before the sun goes down.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Watch the &lsquo;Lowering of the Pirate Wench&rsquo; at Schooner Wharf</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If kids are old enough and interested in staying out until midnight, we suggest you choose a place off of Duval Street, closer to Harbor Walk. Schooner Wharf in the harbor could be a good option. Every year at midnight, a pirate wench begins her descent down the mast of a ship as cannons go off in celebration.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Livestream Duval Street from a Safe Distance</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a full day of activities, dinner, and watching the final sunset of the year, everyone might be ready to head back to the hotel. Grab a drink from the poolside bar and relax. If everyone&rsquo;s still up around midnight, you can stream <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/livestream-web-cams-key-west/\">live webcams</a> around Key West to watch what&rsquo;s going on in Old Town. The live webcam for <a href=\"https://liveduvalstreet.com/\">Duval Street</a> captures the scene outside Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s, which gets packed around midnight.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/rooms/\">What are you waiting for?

  "more_content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Celebrating the late American author, Key West resident, bar companion and angler, the 38th Annual Hemingway Days will be celebrated this year July 17-22.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the official schedule hasn&rsquo;t yet been revealed, all the whacky, competitive, interesting and simply fun mainstay events are planned as usual: the Hemingway look-alike contest, running of the bulls, marlin tournament, and more.<br /><br />Ernest Hemingway found his home-away-from-home in Key West in the 1930s after visiting the island by chance to pick up a car. He and his first wife, Pauline, purchased an old mansion in disrepair at 907 Whitehead Street, which is now the Hemingway Museum and home to many 6-toed cats.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hosted by Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s, the Papa Look-Alike Contest is a popular event, with three rounds of bearded men contending for the greatest likeness to Papa Hemingway.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most eye-catching event is the Running of the Bulls, with Papa look-alikes parading through Old Town on makeshift bulls. This annual event is an homage to Hemingway&rsquo;s love of the Fiesta de Ferm&iacute;n in Pamplona, Spain.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All gags aside, the Key West Marlin Tournament is an ode to Hemingway&rsquo;s love for deep-sea fishing. Spanning three days, the biggest catch wins a $50k prize. <a href=\"http://www.keywestmarlin.com/tournament-schedule/\">Check the schedule</a> to see evening weigh-ins and gatherings at the Waterfront Brewery.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additional museum events, arm wrestling contests and more will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/ernest-hemingway/\">Read more</a> about the Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum when booking your trip to Key West.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p><em>Treat yourself to a trip to Key West.

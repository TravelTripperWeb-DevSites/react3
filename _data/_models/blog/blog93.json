It&rsquo;s an essential ingredient to the Florida State Pie and the balancing sour to our sweet tooth. Every July we celebrate our beloved local citrus with the <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/five-reasons-to-go-to-the-key-lime-festival-this-july-fourth-weekend/\">Key Lime Pie Festival</a>, glorified in the form of pie-eating contests, giant pie creations, fireworks, and Key lime delicacies. While Key lime is usually served in the form of a sweet pie, it also compliments liquor, spicy peppers, rum, nuts, a French Toast breakfast -- you name it, it&rsquo;s probably been tried here on the island.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Without further ado, here&rsquo;s some Key lime treats to be enjoyed across the island outside of its usual pie-form.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Key Lime Drink @ Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the mood to sip on a spiked Key lime pie? <a href=\"https://sloppyjoes.com/menu-3/\">Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s</a> can make it happen -- and you can&rsquo;t get any more Key West than a boozy Key lime pie drink at Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s on Duval Street. They serve up this island concoction with Key lime sour, vodka, Liquor 43, and a splash of orange juice, topped with cream. Enjoy your night-cap and dessert all in one cup. Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s is located at 201 Duval Street in Old Town.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Key Lime Pie French Toast @ Azur Restaurant</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">French toast that&rsquo;s uniquely Key West. For a sweet and sour breakfast, Azur&rsquo;s Key Lime Pie French Toast is grilled with vanilla custard, Key Lime Pie and served with wild berry compote. It&rsquo;s as flavorful as it sounds. Make a special day for brunch and grab a seat in the outdoor terrace at <a href=\"https://sloppyjoes.com/menu-3/\">Azur Restaurant</a> -- located at 425 Grinnell Street.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/the-history-behind-key-lime-pie/\">[The History Behind Key Lime Pie]</a></em></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Key West Key Lime Hot Sauce @ Peppers of Key West</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The &ldquo;hottest spot on the island&rdquo; is at Peppers of Key West, a store dedicated to hot sauce. The Key West Key Lime Hot Sauce is an excellent souvenir to bring along home with you to always have that distinct taste of Key West. Serrano and ancho peppers are balanced with the unique sourness of Key lime juice and zest. It&rsquo;s especially spicy -- a 10 according to their scale -- so use sparingly on whatever tickles your fancy. <a href=\"http://www.peppersofkeywest.com/\">Peppers of Key West</a> is located near Mallory Square at 602 Greene Street.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Key Lime bath products @ Kermit&rsquo;s Key West Key Lime Shoppe</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Turns out Key lime doesn&rsquo;t need to be consumed to be enjoyed. Stock up on your Key lime bathing essentials at <a href=\"https://www.keylimeshop.com/\">Kermit&rsquo;s</a>, which offers shampoo and conditioner, soaps, lip balm and moisturizer. It smells divine. Kermit&rsquo;s has two Old Town locations -- one near the Key West Bight at 200 Elizabeth Street; the other on the corner of Duval and Front streets at 431 Front Street.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p><em><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-c140b5db-d986-bf92-6404-aa8b3f4d0668\">Booking a stay in Key West? <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/specials/\">Check out 24 North Hotel for great deals</a>.</span></em></p>",

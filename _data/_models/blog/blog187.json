Mark your calendar for The Allman Betts Band, set to play at the Sunset Green Event Lawn in Key West on Oct. 28.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The band is a progeny of The Allman Brothers Band, so concert goers can expect classic tunes as well as exceptional songs from solo projects.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Led by Devon Allman and Dickey Betts, sons of Gregg Allman and Dickey Betts respectively, the first tour for the southern rockers jam-packed with shows. It&rsquo;s only natural that Berry Duane Oakley Jr., son of the founding bass player, joins the crew on bass. The men have decades of experience touring and jamming with musicians &ndash; their success at creating their own sound, full-bodied songs and a comfortable performance space seems only second-nature.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.allmanbettsband.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See The Allman Betts Band perform their new hit single</a></em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The outdoor concert will be held at the <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/weddings-and-events/\">Sunset Green Event Lawn</a> at 3820 N.

Looking for a &ldquo;music festival&rdquo; that really pushes the envelope? Put on your flippers and head down to the Florida Keys for the annual Lower Keys Underwater Music Festival.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Every July, hundreds of divers and snorkelers gather for the underwater experience at the Looe Key Reef, a protected area of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary near Big Pine Key. The local radio station, US 1 Radio - 104.1 FM, broadcasts underwater-themed jams (think &lsquo;Octupus&rsquo;s Garden&rsquo; by The Beatles) through underwater speakers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It&rsquo;s a fact that music travels faster in water than out of it, so the experience has been described as celestial.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1556200471688\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1556200461/g2bauvp4h7bm0whm68rs.jpg\" alt=\"underwater-music-fest-florida\" width=\"601\" height=\"338\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1556200461/g2bauvp4h7bm0whm68rs.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1556200461/g2bauvp4h7bm0whm68rs.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1556200461/g2bauvp4h7bm0whm68rs.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1556200461/g2bauvp4h7bm0whm68rs.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1556200461/g2bauvp4h7bm0whm68rs.jpg\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The quirky idea has been held for nearly 35 years on the Saturday following the Fourth of July. Participants often enjoy the gathering in costume, because why not? The founders say the whole idea is to celebrate the reef and also garner support for its protection.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Keys&rsquo; economy <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/business/environment/florida-reef/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">depends greatly on the preservation of the reef,</a> so what better way to spur the public&rsquo;s interest than showcasing the reef&rsquo;s beauty?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This year&rsquo;s event is slated for July 5 from 10am to 2pm. Join the fish in this other-worldly music experience! The Key Lime Pie Festival will be held this year July 4-7, so book a special trip to Key West to enjoy all the zany festivals of the Keys.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Check out our <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/rooms/\">nightly rates at 24 North Hotel</a> &ndash; we have a Starbucks on site, we offer shuttle service to Old Town every hour, and our pool area is one of the best on the island.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">See our <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/specials/\">special offers</a>, which include special rates for Florida residents.</p>",

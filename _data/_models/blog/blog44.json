So, maybe don&rsquo;t get too hung up on the wardrobe. Here&rsquo;s some tips for dressing right or not at all for Fantasy Fest.</p>\n<p>This year&rsquo;s Fantasy Fest theme is:&nbsp;<strong>In Tune But Off Key: 40 Years of Fantasy Fest</strong>, so get creative! We expect to see some musical costumes and rock star likenesses, so pick your closest match and plan accordingly.</p>\n<p>Another option is to forget the threads and lather on the paint. Ask anyone on the island: if you have clothes on during Fantasy Fest, you&rsquo;ll stand out. So check out your options for a paint job, which run from $50-$150 depending on what you&rsquo;re looking for. Some do airbrush, others hand paint their masterpieces. <a href=\"http://www.paradisetattoo.com/body-painting/\">Paradise Tattoo</a> on Duval Street has painted their fair share of people, as well as the renowned <a href=\"http://rockstarairbrush.com/?page_id=213\">Joe Carter</a>. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxjARK81P0oOeWiP2CR9SxA\">Mike Epperhart</a> does airbrush body art year-round at the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Garden+of+Eden/@24.5580922,-81.8068936,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d1b6ebbfc70237:0x50e6dbb0186fd927!8m2!3d24.5580922!4d-81.8046996?hl=en\">Garden of Eden</a> nude bar. For securing a spot at any of these venues, we recommend you schedule an appointment beforehand.</p>\n<p>For those who are getting painted, know that the beads you collect sort of wax off the body paint, so have designated bead person in your group.</p>\n<p>Another thing to keep mind is that everyone&rsquo;s taking photos at Fantasy Fest. That means that photos of you in your birthday suit going online are a great possibility. If this is an issue we suggest you opt for a mask, which can be picked up at <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fairvilla+Megastore/@28.5667937,-81.4027944,21z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x88e77a6baa6b63f9:0xb6da27344c226aff!8m2!3d28.5667809!4d-81.4028158?hl=en\">Fairvilla</a>.</p>\n<p>And, we can&rsquo;t stress this enough: <strong>wear good walking shoes</strong>. You&rsquo;re going to be on your feet the entire time, and flip flops may not cut it. Also, the sun still shines in Key West during October, with temps regularly in the 80s. The less clothes you wear, the more likely you are to get sunburned. Maybe don a time-traveling hat to keep the sun out of your face and hydrate accordingly!</p>\n<p>For more tips as to what to pack for Fantasy Fest, check out or list <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/five-things-to-pack-for-fantasy-fest/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p><em>Ready to join us for Fantasy Fest?

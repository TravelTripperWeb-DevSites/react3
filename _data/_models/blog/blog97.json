If you&rsquo;re in town for a stint, make sure to taste our local brews. Here&rsquo;s a list of Florida Key Breweries to look out for.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.thewaterfrontbrewery.com/\">The Waterfront Brewery</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Located on the Key West Seaport and Bight, The Waterfront Brewery is a must if you&rsquo;re in Key West. The brewery, restaurant, and entertainment spot rotates their taps and also sticks with their mainstays: the Crazy Lady Blonde Ale, brewed with local honey; and the Island Life Lager, a Standard American brew that&rsquo;s crisp and clean. The brewpub offers tours, an excellent menu with fresh food, and a game room. <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/dZ65djEf5sR2\">201 William Street, Old Town</a></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://firstflightkw.com/\">First Flight Island Restaurant &amp; Brewery</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Southernmost Microbrewery offers three carefully-crafted brews on tap at the First Flight Restaurant. The restaurant is set in the original offices of the Pan American World Airways. Check out the restaurant, featuring a delightful treetop terrace, garden dining, and an airplane hanging over the bar. <a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/First+Flight+Island+Restaurant+%26+Brewery/@24.5573517,-81.8075478,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d1b6ebeffd5a67:0x4b2db929467e4e0e!8m2!3d24.5573517!4d-81.8053538\">301 Whitehead Street, Old Town<br /><br /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/unique-key-west-bars/\">[Bars with History: Unique Key West Watering Holes]</a></em></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.floridakeysbrewingco.com/\">Florida Keys Brewing Company</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Upper Keys first microbrewery, the Florida Keys Brewing Company is exciting because of all the local flavors packed in the brews. Try their Iguana Bait brew, that uses local hibiscus and honey to create this flavorful honey hibiscus kolsch. Their Flakeys light citrus beer is a local favorite. The brewing company is a constant at our local brew festivals. Check local beer place <a href=\"http://www.theporchrestaurantandbar.com/\">The Porch</a> to see if you can grab a brew from Florida Keys Brewing Company.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.islamoradabeerco.com/\">Islamorada Beer Company</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The brewery located to the north in Islamorada packs their beers with island flavors. With names like &ldquo;Key Lime Sparkling Water,&rdquo; &ldquo;No Tan Lines,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hillbilly Days,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s doubtful you&rsquo;ll forget the taste of Islamorada. Keep an eye out for their beers at KW restaurant <a href=\"https://www.915duval.com/\">Nine One Five</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.corkandstogie.com/\">Cork &amp; Stogie</a> bar, and <a href=\"http://www.islamoradabeerco.com/where-to-buy/\">other island locations.</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Booking your vacation at the Conch Republic? <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/specials/\">Check out rates at 24 North Hotel.</a></em></p>",

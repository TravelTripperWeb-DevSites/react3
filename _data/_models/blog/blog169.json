Looking for your piece of paradise? Here are some suggestions.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">West Martello Tower and Gardens</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The historic, 19th-century military lookout is surrounded by tropical gardens, lovingly maintained by the Key West Garden Club. It&rsquo;s a quiet spot in Key West, located right on the water of Higgs Beach. Open daily from 9:30 to 5 pm. Admission is free, though donations are kindly accepted.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The quiet side of Bahama Village</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tourists tend to come to this neighborhood in the southern part of Old Town for popular restaurants like Blue Heaven, but they don&rsquo;t explore the rest of it. Named after people of the Caribbean who settled in the area in the 1800s, <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/bahama-village-things-to-do-key-west/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bahama Village</a> has Conch-style architecture painted with bright colors, quaint eateries and the Bahama Village Market on Petronia Street. Check out the Blue Macaw for a build-your-own Bloody Mary. <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/bahama-village-things-to-do-key-west/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read more on Bahama Village. </a></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Smathers Beach</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Located in <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/best-things-to-do-in-new-town/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New Town</a>, Smathers is the sandiest and largest beach on the island. It doesn&rsquo;t get too crowded, and you can rent beach equipment, snorkel gear or just about any watersport vessel from Sunset Watersports, conveniently located on the beach. Pack an umbrella or arrive early to claim a coveted shady spot under the palm trees. Make sure to bring cash so you can take advantage of food trucks lined up along the beach! Parking is free on the street.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Mangrove tidal creeks</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Kayak with <a href=\"https://lazydog.com/\">Lazy Dog Adventures</a> for peace and quiet in the mangroves, where the only crowds you&rsquo;ll encounter are feathered friends. Embark in the morning before the temperatures rise and paddle around to disconnect and clear your mind.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">---</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Come see the island&rsquo;s unique charm for yourself! Key West is home to the <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/ernest-hemingway/\">Hemingway Home &amp; Museum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/mallory-square/\">Mallory Square</a>, where you can watch <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/key-weird-sunsets-green-flash/\">epic sunsets</a>, celebrated every day.

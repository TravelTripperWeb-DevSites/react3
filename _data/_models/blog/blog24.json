  "more_content": "<p>Back before gay travel was even a thing, Key West set the standard, proclaiming itself THE gay destination. Forty years later, Key West is still the open-minded, anything goes and all-welcoming destination it was back in the 70s. And while some spots have come and gone, many have still remained the same. That said, here are some of our favorite happenings in Gay Key West:</p>\n<h4>The Sunday Afternoon Tea Dance</h4>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t your grandmother&rsquo;s tea party. However, the weekly <a href=\"http://lateda.com/tea-dance/\">Tea Dance at La Te Da</a> is an absolute must. A Gay Key West tradition, the Sunday afternoon tea dance has been around for a long, long time - and it just keeps getting better. Here you can dance your heart out to gay disco classics and plenty of the Weather Girls. There&rsquo;s also no shortage of drinks in case you happen to be shy. The Tea Dance is held every Sunday, from 4 -7 pm at La Te Da.</p>\n<h4>Sailing with Blu Q</h4>\n<p>Blu Q is known for its Key West Gay Sailing Adventures. As the island&rsquo;s longest running gay sailing charter, <a href=\"http://www.bluqkeywest.com/\">Blu Q</a> offers a whole slew of water activities geared toward the gay community, from snorkeling and kayaking to sandbar excursions and sunset sails. Clothing does tend to be optional on these cruises, so if you&rsquo;ve been waiting to skinny dip, this is your chance.</p>\n<h4>See Sushi at 801 Bourbon</h4>\n<p>801 Bourbon Bar is where you&rsquo;ll find Key West&rsquo;s reigning drag queen Sushi performing. Although you might only know her from NYE Shoe Drop fame, Sushi and the <a href=\"http://www.801bourbon.com/cabaret.html\">801 Girls</a> perform at the upstairs cabaret at this popular Duval Street bar. Shows are nightly at both 9 &amp; 11 p.m. For more drag shows on the island, check out our <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/drag-shows-key-west/\">favorites</a>.</p>\n<h4>Pride</h4>\n<p>Our Guide to the Gay Key West wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without mentioning <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/24-north-picks-key-west-pride/\">Key West Pride</a>, which in our opinion is the most beautiful Pride display in the country, thanks to the mile-long rainbow flag that stretches from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean. It&rsquo;s pride from sea to shining sea, every June in the Conch Republic. We hope to see you there.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p><em>Joining us for Key West Pride? &nbsp;Check out our <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/specials/\">specials here</a>.</em></p>",

McCoy traveled from Cuba to Key West on water skis the same year Nyad attempted to swim the channel &ndash; which she finally completed 30 years later.</p>\n<p>In 1978, the island&rsquo;s then-mayor McCoy was inspired to make the 100+ mile journey because of a challenge from a local reporter and chance conversation with President Jimmy Carter, <a href=\"http://floridakeys.net/news.cfm?newsid=1152\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">according to a Florida Keys Directory.</a></p>\n<p>So, the mayor set off on a calm September morning and completed the trip from Key West to Cuba in six hours and 10 minutes, which was admittedly uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I felt terrible until about 10 miles out of Key West, and for the next 100 miles I was feeling awful,&rdquo; McCoy said in a <a href=\"https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6cNaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MFoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6752%2C3027211\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1978 article in the St. Petersburg Times.</a> &ldquo;After that it got worse.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The mayor of Key West met 5-foot waves during the grueling trip. He used a 10-year-old single slalom ski, in which both feet affix to one ski. McCoy prevailed the 110-mile stretch to Cuba, where he was escorted by Cuban gunboats to the Havana Harbor.</p>\n<p>Only the mayor of the Conch Republic would partake in such a unique challenge while in office.</p>\n<p>Coincidentally, long-distance swimmer <a href=\"http://diananyad.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Diana Nyad</a> attempted her first of five attempts to swim from Cuba to Florida that same year. As you may know, Nyad eventually completed the task in 2013, over 30 years after her first attempt. She was 64 years old. The swim took over 53 hours, and she was named the first person confirmed to swim from Cuba to Florida without a shark cage.</p>\n<p>Right after the trip&rsquo;s completion, as she was one her way to be revised by medics, Nyad was congratulated by former-Key West Mayor McCoy.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Interested in the weird side of Key West?

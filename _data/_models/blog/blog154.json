A Key West native, Sanchez worked with wood and paint, mostly creating bas relief carvings that reflect images of earlier times on the island that were never captured in photos. Today, his artworks hang in the Smithsonian in Washington D.C., as well as the Gallery on Greene in Key West.</p>\n<p>Sanchez was born in 1908, the son of cigar makers in Key West. He grew up in Gato Village, which was a small community of roughly 40 cottages built by the E.H. Gato Cigar Company. The village was made up of Cuban immigrants who worked in the factory, rolling thousands of cigars by hand every day.</p>\n<p>The Sanchez family immigrated to Key West toward the end of Spain&rsquo;s rule in Cuba. Sanchez&rsquo;s grandfather owned a grocery shop in town and was a musician, often playing outside his store &ndash; a scene that appears in one of Sanchez&rsquo;s pieces.</p>\n<p>The height of cigar production in Key West had passed by the time Sanchez was born, but some factories still remained. His father worked as a lector in the factories, reading to cigar workers as a means to pass time. The young Sanchez became familiar with such scenes, which later showed up in one of his most significant works. <a href=\"https://keywest.floridaweekly.com/articles/mario-sanchez-first-key-west-artist-inducted-into-the-smithsonian/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&ldquo;The Reader and the Cigar Makers&rdquo; (1963)</a> depicts his father reading to a group of workers rolling cigars in the E.H. Gato Factory. In 2017, the painting was inducted into the Smithsonian American Art Museum.</p>\n<p>Sanchez began making art in the 1930s out of cedar wood and other raw materials. He was self-taught and never pursued a career in art. Sanchez earned a degree in stenography and worked for Monroe County in his field. He nurtured his creative side by making art in his free time and writing short comedy plays that were performed in the <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/san-carlos-institute/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">San Carlos Institute</a> in Old Town.</p>\n<p>To see some of Sanchez&rsquo;s art while in Key West, visit the <a href=\"http://galleryongreene.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gallery on Greene</a> at 606 Greene Street in Old Town. The renowned art gallery has a handful of the artist&rsquo;s works on display, which convey street scenes of old Key West.

However, if you&rsquo;re looking to switch it up and dress up to go out, here are some of the best lounge atmospheres in the Conch Republic.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://aandblobsterhouse.com/\">Berlin&rsquo;s Cigar &amp; Cocktail Bar</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Discreetly located above the A&amp;B Lobster Restaurant, Berlin&rsquo;s is one of the coolest lounges on the island, outfitted with leather couches and excellent views of the Key West Bight. They serve up thoughtful cocktails and martinis. While it&rsquo;s a place to enjoy a cigar, the airflow is remarkably clear. Stop at Berlin&rsquo;s after dinner to enjoy a nightcap in a classic setting. <a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/700+Front+St,+Key+West,+FL+33040,+USA/@24.5615669,-81.8057228,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d1b6eb26aac4f5:0xd242e0110271e284!8m2!3d24.5615669!4d-81.8035288?hl=en\">700 Front St.</a></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.laconchakeywest.com/dine-drinks/wine-o.aspx\">Wine-O Bar</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This little sophisticated spot is a nice reprieve from the heat with a sleek, modern decor and an extensive wine menu. They also feature charcuterie plates, small bites and desserts to pair with your wine. Call ahead to ask about their happy hour specials. <a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/430+Duval+St,+Key+West,+FL+33040,+USA/@24.5559652,-81.8057133,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d1b6e978b87451:0x20be731010f30421!8m2!3d24.5559652!4d-81.8035193?hl=en\">430 Duval St.</a></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.corkandstogie.com/\">Cork &amp; Stogie</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cork &amp; Stogie is a casual cigar and wine lounge, and the most&nbsp;laid-back&nbsp;on the list. It&rsquo;s family-owned and operated with a laid-back atmosphere and outdoor porch seating. Cigars are sold at Cork &amp; Stogie (complete with a humidor) and boasts an extensive wine menu. Cork &amp; Stogie is located near the southernmost point of the island, so get in the spirit and enjoy a fine Cuban cigar and drink. <a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/1218+Duval+St,+Key+West,+FL+33040,+USA/@24.5484777,-81.7997501,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d1b6dce1470231:0xa68e701aadefaab7!8m2!3d24.5484777!4d-81.7975614?hl=en\">1218 Duval St.</a></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.915duval.com/point5\">Point 5 Lounge</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Upstairs from the Nine One Five restaurant, the Point 5 lounge&nbsp;offers an extensive wine menu and outdoor porch seating all set in an old Victorian home. We recommend you check out the tapas menu (there&rsquo;s also full fare available) and grab a seat outside on the wraparound porch. This is a great spot to wind down the night. <a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/Point+5/@24.551618,-81.8015919,17z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x88d1b6c2befa5ad3:0xfa09266f5a74d26f!2s915+Duval+St,+Key+West,+FL+33040,+USA!3b1!8m2!3d24.551618!4d-81.7993979!3m4!1s0x88d1b6c2bef0748d:0x6c9078b449c2fa2d!8m2!3d24.5516025!4d-81.7994203?hl=en\">915 Duval St.</a></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.betterthansexdesserts.com/\">Better Than Sex</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is technically a dessert restaurant, but its private-booth-lounge-like atmosphere made us include it on the list. Better Than Sex is an experience for couples or for parties smaller than four, with a creative dessert menu and bar. This is a popular spot in Key West, so make sure to make a reservation ahead of time. <a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/Better+Than+Sex+-+A+Dessert+Restaurant+Key+West/@24.5519442,-81.8003493,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d1b6e825332b75:0xb055758bcc80b27a!8m2!3d24.5519442!4d-81.7981553?hl=en\">926 Simonton St.</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Booking a stay in Key West? <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/specials/\">Check out specials at 24 North Hotel.</a></em></p>",

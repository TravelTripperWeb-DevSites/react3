It&rsquo;s simple to make, fresh, light, and works as a great appetizer, lunch, or snack enjoyed with a cold beer. Conch salad is a variation of ceviche, which is as simple as fish cured in lime juice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Key West is pretty <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/relaxed-lazy-ways-spend-day-key-west/\">laid-back,</a> and so is the process of making conch salad. You don&rsquo;t need a stove or oven to make conch salad; just some fresh limes, conch meat, and whatever else you&rsquo;d like to add in, such as onions, celery, tomatoes and jalape&ntilde;os. Sweeten up your conch salad with mango or pineapple, which pairs nicely with the heat of a habanero pepper for spiceheads.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What you'll need:</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Traditional conch salad</em><br /><em>1 lb of conch meat</em><br /><em>&frac34; cup fresh key lime juice</em><br /><em>1 small, diced onion</em><br /><em>Handful of chopped tomato</em><br /><em>Handful of chopped bell pepper</em><br /><em>Salt and pepper to taste</em><br /><em>Juice from 1 orange</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First, mince conch meat into small pieces. Mix ingredients and let sit for at least half an hour; if possible allow to sit in the sun while curing.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you&rsquo;d like to add peppers, cucumbers, celery, cilantro, or chives, simply do so at the start of the process. Conch salad is easy and can be made with just about any fresh ingredients you have on-hand. It can be eaten by itself with a fork, or with tortilla chips, plantain chips, or crackers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Interested in the other conch cuisine of the Conch Republic?

The impact has received <a href=\"http://wlrn.org/post/keys-lobster-mini-season-holiday-and-ordeal\">mixed reviews from locals.</a> However, if everyone plays by the rules applicable to Monroe County, the lobster mini season can be enjoyed by everyone. Here are some rules to follow, which are strictly enforced on and off the water. Play fair and happy hunting!</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Do</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>&ndash;</strong>Have everything ready before launching your boat. This ensures that everyone gets into the water quickly, there are no outbursts at the boat launch, and everyone&rsquo;s happy.<br /><strong>&ndash;</strong>Have a measuring device on you at all times. Spiny lobsters must have a carapace larger than 3 inches (starting from rostral horns to the bottom edge of the carapace). If you&rsquo;re confused about what this is, where it is or how to measure it, <a href=\"http://myfwc.com/fishing/saltwater/recreational/fish-measurement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">refer to FWC&rsquo;s measuring guide.</a><strong>&ndash;</strong>Measure the lobster in the water<br /><strong>&ndash;</strong>Have your saltwater fishing license on you at all times, with the required spiny lobster tag.<br /><strong>&ndash;</strong>Keep the lobster intact, from catch to shore arrival.<br /><strong>&ndash;</strong>Enjoy a 6-lobster maximum per day (Monroe County &amp; Biscayne National Park). 12-lobster max in the rest of Florida.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Don&rsquo;t</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>&ndash;</strong>Catch six spiny lobsters and go out in the same day for six more.<br /><strong>&ndash;</strong>Keep female lobsters with eggs under the tail. Female lobsters with eggs must be released.<br /><strong>&ndash;</strong>Use traps.<br /><strong>&ndash;</strong>Remove the tail before docking. Lobsters must be caught and landed in one piece.<br /><strong>&ndash;</strong>Use spears. Or spear guns.<br /><strong>&ndash;</strong>Harvest lobsters in the Biscayne Bay/Card Sound Lobster Sanctuary; Dry Tortugas; the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. <a href=\"https://www.monroecounty-fl.gov/DocumentCenter/View/1520/Monroe-County-Lobster-Guide-NOAAgov?bidId=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See other prohibited areas on the FWC list.</a><strong>&ndash;</strong>Dive at night. &ldquo;Night&rdquo; is defined as one hour after official sunset to one hour before official sunrise.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/key-weird-series-capt-tonys/\">[Key Weird Series: Capt.

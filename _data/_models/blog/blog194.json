This allegedly haunted doll has scared the bejesus out of the general public for decades. Gifted to a young boy on the island back in 1904, Robert the Doll is said to regularly change his facial expression, move all on his own, and has been heard giggling. He's also picky about who takes his picture, and many folks believe to be cursed by him after snapping a photo. He&rsquo;s so infamous that he&rsquo;s been the subject of films, television shows, attracting ghost hunters, psychics and the curious from far and wide.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Ernest Hemingway</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/ernest-hemingway/\"><strong>The Hemingway Home &amp; Museum</strong><br /></a>While Robert the Doll is every bit creepy, the Hemingway ghost is as laid-back as they come. Before news of Hemingway&rsquo;s death in 1961 reached the island, neighbors had reportedly seen Papa on his second-floor veranda. Turns out it may have been a mirage. Since then, the late writer has been spotted in the same place, sometimes giving a polite wave to passersby. His late second wife and journalist Pauline Pfeiffer, is also reportedly seen at times smoking cigarettes in the backyard.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Lady in Blue</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/key-weird-series-capt-tonys/\"><strong>Capt. Tony&rsquo;s Saloon</strong><br /></a>This <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/key-weird-series-capt-tonys/\">old-time bar</a> on Greene Street has a lot of mystery surrounding it, some tall tales likely invented by its late, great owner and former mayor, <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/captain-tony-key-west-barkeep-mayor/\">Capt. Tony.</a> Regardless, The Lady in Blue is said to frequent the bar, specifically around its famed hanging tree. Legend says the tree was used as a lynching post for those guilty of piracy in olden days. The Lady in Blue was hanged from the tree after killing her children and husband. Today, she&rsquo;s believed to haunt the premises. What do you think? We recommend you go in and have a drink and see for yourself.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Barbara Mabrity</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/key-west-lighthouse-museum/\"><strong>Key West Lighthouse &amp; Keeper&rsquo;s Quarters Museum</strong><br /></a>This friendly ghost is believed to be the former lighthouse keeper, Barbara Mabrity. She held the position for nearly 40 years after taking over for her late husband in 1832, who died from yellow fever. Alone with her six children, she maintained the lighthouse and carried out all the duties of her position, scaling its 88 steps daily. Mabrity braved powerful hurricanes and tropical storms, even escaping the lighthouse before it <a href=\"https://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2016/01/the-long-blue-line-barbara-mabrity-long-time-lighthouse-keeper-and-hurricane-heroine/\">crumbled in 1846</a>. Mabrity retired from her post when she was 80 years old and died three years later. Today, people say they can hear the lighthouse keeper climbing the stairs.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Key West has lots more intriguing ghost stories. Curious to learn more?

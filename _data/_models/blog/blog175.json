Unrelated to the sloppy joe sandwich, Sloppy Joe was a real Key West character who spent his time as a boat captain, rumrunner, fisherman, saloon keeper and friend to <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/ernest-hemingway/\">Ernest Hemingway.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During the prohibition era, &ldquo;Sloppy&rdquo; Joe Russell ran illegal speakeasies in Key West.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once prohibition ended, Russell&rsquo;s covert barkeeping became legitimate and he opened the Blind Pig, a run-down saloon that served booze and neglected ambiance. A dance floor was later added and the name changed to the Silver Slipper. Whiskey cost 15 cents and soon the jack-of-all-trades met Ernest Hemingway, who was known to like a stiff drink.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Russell later inspired the character of Freddy the barkeep in Hemingway&rsquo;s To Have and Have Not, published in 1937. In real life, Russell was Hemingway&rsquo;s boat pilot and fishing companion.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1553888188330\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1553888183/e1r58jfpjut6zquch4ls.jpg\" alt=\"sloppy-joes-key-west-stage\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1553888183/e1r58jfpjut6zquch4ls.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1553888183/e1r58jfpjut6zquch4ls.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1553888183/e1r58jfpjut6zquch4ls.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1553888183/e1r58jfpjut6zquch4ls.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1553888183/e1r58jfpjut6zquch4ls.jpg\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Legend has it that Papa Hemingway was the one who convinced Russell to change the name of his bar to &ldquo;Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s&rdquo; after a bar in Havana, whose proprietor was known for running a sloppy establishment.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The name stuck.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 1937, the rent at Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s shot up, prompting Russell and patrons to move his bar across the street. With drinks in hand, the transition to the bar&rsquo;s current location at 201 Duval Street went on without skipping a beat (or round).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Today, Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s Bar is iconic Key West &ndash; authentically scruffy, good humored and a gathering place for all, open every day of the year from 9am to 4am. Swing by for a rum runner and enjoy live music daily from noon to 2am.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you&rsquo;re in Key West in July, don&rsquo;t miss out on the bar&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/hemingway-days-key-west/\">Papa Look-Alike Contest</a>, an annual part of <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/hemingway-days-key-west/\">Hemingway Days</a> that started in 1981.

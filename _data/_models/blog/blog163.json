They offer <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/best-raw-bars-in-key-west/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">oysters on the half shell</a> along with other finger foods like coconut shrimp, fried calamari and onion rings.

It&rsquo;s a local favorite. 231 Margaret St.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Schooner Wharf Bar</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Schooner&rsquo;s is a funky Key West tradition that just seems to get better with age. With a relaxed, casual vibe, you&rsquo;ll find good food like mahi sandwiches, tuna nachos and conch fritters, as well as creative drinks like their painkiller and the dark and stormy. There&rsquo;s also live music every evening. Ask for a table up on the roof. 202 William St. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Southernmost Beach Cafe</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Right on the beach on the Atlantic end of Duval St., the Southernmost Beach Cafe offers a full menu including items like a Cuban egg roll appetizer as well as lobster, chicken and steak options. Visitors rave about their rum runners and margaritas. This is your chance to dine with your toes in the sand as you admire the Key West sunset from the southernmost point of the United States. 1405 Duval St.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Latitudes</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No sunset restaurant roundup would be complete without the iconic Latitudes restaurant. Reserve in advance and enjoy the included boat ride out to Sunset Key. There you can select from a luxe menu of duck, snapper, shrimp, lobster bisque, surf and turf, and much more. The historic property is surrounded by lush greenery, and it&rsquo;s the perfect place for a romantic, memorable dinner on the island.

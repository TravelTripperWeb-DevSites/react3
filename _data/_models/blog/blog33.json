This year marks the event&rsquo;s eighth year, chock full of activities across Key West with participating hotels, restaurants and bars. Last year&rsquo;s BrewFest chalked up approximately 200 options for beer enthusiasts, and its signature tasting festival sold out after just two hours.</p>\n<p>BrewFest officially kicks off Thursday, Aug. 31, and stretches over the weekend with a variety of activities through Monday, Sept. 4. Beer classes, tastings, brunches and beer bingo guarantee something to drink for everyone. <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/\">24 North</a> Hotel is pleased to be part of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1540758295986738/?acontext=%7B%22action_history%22%3A%22[%7B%5C%22surface%5C%22%3A%5C%22page%5C%22%2C%5C%22mechanism%5C%22%3A%5C%22page_upcoming_events_card%5C%22%2C%5C%22extra_data%5C%22%3A[]%7D]%22%2C%22has_source%22%3Atrue%7D\">Bud Light Beer Pong Party Tour</a>, along with three other participating hotels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The poolside day event takes place Sunday, Sept. 3.

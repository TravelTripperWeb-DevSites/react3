  "more_content": "<p>Key West is no stranger to weddings or honeymoons. At <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/\">24 North</a>, we&rsquo;re gearing up to host our fair share of weddings at the soon-to-be opened event lawn, <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/event-lawn/\">The Sunset Green</a>. While we hope the lawfully wedded both enjoy their special day, we think a wedding planner helps ease the process. Check out our 10 reasons why you can&rsquo;t get married without a wedding planner below.</p>\n<h3>1. Buying time is happiness</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/08/28/545839192/need-a-happiness-boost-spend-your-money-to-buy-time-not-more-stuff\">A recent study</a> actually shows that <strong>buying time instead of things</strong> can make you happier. By paying for a wedding planner, you are actually affording yourself free time instead of stressing over the details and paperwork of vendors.</p>\n<h3>2. Save money in the long-run</h3>\n<p>Wedding planners have experience &mdash; think of them as being locals in the world of weddings. They know how to negotiate deals, where to get more bang for your buck &mdash; so leave it up to them. If you have a strict budget, a wedding planner is versed in shortcuts and money-saving tricks. Plus, chances are they have contract and package perks that save in the long run.</p>\n<h3>3. You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing</h3>\n<p>We&rsquo;re not trying to be harsh on you, but unless you&rsquo;ve planned your share of weddings, be prepared to be unprepared. A wedding planner knows which vendors are reliable because they are repeat customers.</p>\n<h3>4. They think of things you won&rsquo;t</h3>\n<p>The bridal party outfits are gowns instead of cocktail dresses, you can&rsquo;t use an outside vendor, you have to hire the photographer and videographer separately &hellip; again, this won&rsquo;t be your wedding planner&rsquo;s first rodeo, though it may be yours. Chances are they&rsquo;ve faced many of the dilemmas you&rsquo;ll face but will be better equipped to deal with them.</p>\n<h3>5. The stress of family is enough on your plate</h3>\n<p>Okay, so your dad wants those personalized koozies, your mother-in-law has her heart set on a photo booth and your sister won&rsquo;t leave the personalized cocktail menu alone. Your family size is doubling; don&rsquo;t underestimate the force of their will. If you have a wedding planner, you also have an ally &mdash; someone who listens to your wishes before interrupting with their own ideas.</p>\n<h3>6. In-house coordinator won&rsquo;t cut it</h3>\n<p>While some venues offer in-house coordinators, keep in mind that you get what you pay for. Most of the time, in-house coordinators are there to ensure that the venue met the contract needs, but nothing beyond that.</p>\n<h3>7. Something always goes wrong</h3>\n<p>The restaurant hosting the rehearsal dinner lost your reservation, the bridal party shoes don&rsquo;t match the dresses, the bakery never got the cake order, the DJ won&rsquo;t pick up her phone. Something always goes awry on the big day. If you have someone in your corner, this won&rsquo;t feel as chaotic for you.</p>\n<h3>8. Enjoy your wedding</h3>\n<p>Even if you have a day-of coordinator, a lot of the worries and stresses will fall on you before you walk down the aisle&hellip; and after.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;9. Let your friends/family enjoy your wedding</h3>\n<p>While it may seem like a good idea to have family help with the wedding, they should have the day off to enjoy the ceremony. Plus it&rsquo;s way easier to turn into a bridezilla with family than with an equitable person hired for the job.</p>\n<h3>10. It&rsquo;s about you</h3>\n<p>This often gets lost in all the pageantry of a wedding. On your wedding day, you&rsquo;re there to celebrate the union of marriage with family and friends. A wedding planner is an objective hand in the process that will ensure you get what you want with less stress.</p>\n<p>--&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Interested in a proposal for booking the Sunset Green?

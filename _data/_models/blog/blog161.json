If you plan on going, &nbsp;make sure to dig into these top five Key West classics:</p>\n<h3>1. Chilled Stone Crab</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This regenerative food source is in season from October through May, and actually tastes more like lobster than most crab meat you&rsquo;re probably used to. <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/key-west-stone-crab-season-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Local stone crab</a> is best enjoyed chilled with a side of mustard sauce &ndash; a far cry from the steamed blue crab served with melted butter.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">2. Grilled Spiny Lobster</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Have you ever eaten a spiny lobster? Unlike lobsters from the north, spiny lobsters don&rsquo;t have meaty claws. You just eat the tail, which tastes best grilled.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">3. Peel &amp; Eat Key West Pinks</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Local shrimp is so sweet and tasty you won&rsquo;t want to order it fried. Order a shrimp cocktail or peel-and-eat shrimp so you can taste the local &ldquo;pink gold&rdquo; that you&rsquo;ve heard so much about.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">4. Conch Fritters</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While in the Conch Republic, eat conch. You can order conch at the seafood festival in a handful of varieties, from conch salad to conch chowder. <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/best-conch-dishes-food-key-west/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">If you&rsquo;re new to conch,</a> we suggest you try good ole conch fritters, which are a Key West favorite.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">5. Key Lime Pie</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a day of chowing down on seafood, make sure you&rsquo;ve saved room for Key West&rsquo;s favorite dessert: <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/the-history-behind-key-lime-pie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Key Lime Pie.</a> This creamy and tangy treat always hits the spot, especially in sunny weather.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The seafood festival is held at <a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/Bayview+Park/@24.556999,-81.7886209,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xcd701d753ed1034a!8m2!3d24.556999!4d-81.7886209?sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirza60qczYAhWr6YMKHVjeAI8Q_BIIiwEwDg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bayview Park</a> in Key West at 1320 Truman Avenue, and runs from 11-6 p.m. Saturday and 11-5 p.m. Sunday.

  "more_content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Key West has an eclectic weirdness of its own, celebrated by its locals and visitors with dedicated enthusiasm.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/\">24 North&rsquo;s</a> previous Key Weird Series, we&rsquo;ve covered <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/keywest-florida-hemingway-house-cats/\">Hemingway&rsquo;s 6-toed cats</a> and the story of <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/key-weird-series-undying-love/\">the real Key West corpse bride</a>. In this installment, we&rsquo;ll look at all the big and small records held by our humble, southernmost island.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">1. Biggest Giant Conch&hellip; anywhere</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">New Year&rsquo;s Eve parties in Key West are internationally-recognized, namely Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s Conch Shell Drop on Duval Street. Each year, Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s lowers the giant, handmade conch as revelers welcome the new year. It's like Times Square but oddly Key West. The Conch Island tradition began in 1993 and has been a hit ever since, joining all those on Duval Street to count down in unison.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">2. The Smallest Parade in the Universe</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That&rsquo;s right -- the smallest parade in the universe is held in Key West during our beloved Fantasy Fest. The <a href=\"http://www.thesmallestparadeintheuniverse.com/\">mini procession</a> celebrated its third year in 2017, with tiny floats making their way down a tiny Duval Street replica. Guests viewed the event projected on a large screen as it took place in miniature onstage. Don&rsquo;t blink or else you might miss the event&rsquo;s fourth year, set for this year&rsquo;s Fantasy Fest. <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com\">Book your stay with us in advance!</a></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">3. Largest Coral Barrier Reef in North America</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All gags aside -- the Florida reef is the only living coral barrier reef in North America, but it ranks third-largest in the world, behind those in Australia and Belize. The reef is located seven miles from Key West and spans 4 miles long. See it for yourself by&nbsp;spending an afternoon snorkeling the coral reef with <a href=\"https://keywestsebago.com/collections/key-west-snorkeling/products/key-west-reef-snorkel-afternoon\">Sebago Key West.</a></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">4. (Former) Record Holder for World&rsquo;s Biggest Key Lime Pie</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The title changed in 2018 to&nbsp;folks on Merritt Island, but in 2013-2014, the Conch Republic broke the Guinness World Record for the largest Key lime pie at 8 and 9 feet respectively, feeding 1,500 people in the process. The recipe called for 6,480 key limes, 60 gallons of sweetened condensed milk and 220 lbs of graham crackers, <a href=\"http://www.jacksonville.com/breaking-news/2014-07-04/story/giant-pie-serves-1500-florida-key-lime-festival\">according to the Florida Times Union</a>. The record&nbsp;seceded to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fla-keys.com/keysvoices/the-worlds-largest-key-lime-pie/\">an impressive 12-foot pie</a>. Our annual Key Lime Pie fest is set for July &hellip; perhaps the Conch Republic can up the ante?</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">5. Smallest Bar in the Key West</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The smallest bar still makes a strong drink! The 72-square foot bar on 124 Duval Street is \"nearly the smallest in the word\" and serves one of the <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/rum-runner-florida-keys-staple/\">best rum runners on the island</a>. Its lack of elbow-room inspires customers to enjoy their libels outside. Owners describe the bar as &ldquo;about the size of a jail cell.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s honestly a great place for people-watching and enjoying a drink.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p><em><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ceb5ba2f-e0a9-60b3-7920-e77203d01811\">Booking a stay in Key West? <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/specials/\">Check out specials at 24 North Hotel.</a></span></em></p>",

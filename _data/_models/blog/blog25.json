So in honor of the national dessert of the Conch Republic, we&rsquo;re here to give you a little background on the greatest snack this side of Cuba.</p>\n<p>No one really knows who came up with the original key lime pie. But one thing&rsquo;s for certain, it could only happen in The Keys. That&rsquo;s because the original key lime pie calls for two ingredients that were endemic to the southernmost islands - key limes and canned milk. Key limes are an obvious ingredient. But canned milk, native to Key West? Well, not exactly &ldquo;native,&rdquo; but almost. To understand that ingredient you have to also understand that fresh dairy products, much less refrigeration were hardly available on Key West until after the 1930s - and key lime pie was a Key West tradition long before that.</p>\n<p>Although fresh dairy was hard to come by, condensed milk was a hot commodity in the late 1850s, thanks to the booming wrecking business on the island. That said, one of Key West&rsquo;s most famous wreckers, William Curry, often gets credited for the original key lime pie, as he was also the one bringing in the canned milk at the time - and then giving it to his cook Aunt Sally, to make the key lime pie we know today. Yet even though Aunt Sally&rsquo;s key lime pie recipe is one of the earliest records, it probably wasn&rsquo;t the first. It probably came from the sponge divers along the reef, who made good use of the local ingredients - key limes, canned milk, graham crackers, and eggs.

  "more_content": "<p>Singer-songwriter <a href=\"http://www.donavonf.com/\">Donavon Frankenreiter</a> will be at the Key West Theater on Sept. 3, playing songs from his most recent album, &ldquo;The Heart.&rdquo; Though the name may not sound familiar, chances are you&rsquo;ve heard him. His <a href=\"https://youtu.be/l3b2k08f3b8\">2004 hit &ldquo;Free&rdquo;</a> featured Jack Johnson, and his surf-rock tunes complete with ukulele make the perfect soundtrack to your island vacation.</p>\n<p>His newest album, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3IPxbbnh0Y&amp;list=PLk2GmGJyLFj_H6h0faYkBE_btS7775F58\">The Heart</a>,&rdquo; is described as a sentimental and honest album, recorded in a studio in Wimberly, Texas, over two weeks. Frankenreiter recorded a song a day, a grueling and serendipitous process which he also live streamed on YouTube. The album came out intimate and honest, said Frankenreiter, and shows his growth over the last decade.</p>\n<p>You can get a full taste of his newest album here on YouTube:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U3IPxbbnh0Y?list=PLk2GmGJyLFj_H6h0faYkBE_btS7775F58\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>His music has a relaxed, island-type feel to it, providing the perfect tunes to our Key West backdrop. The theater has table seating and full bar service, keeping a casual atmosphere.</p>\n<p>This show will take place over Labor Day weekend, which coincides with the <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/brewfest-bud-light-beer-pong-party-tour/\">8th Annual Key West Brewfest</a>. For those looking for a relaxed indoor setting to close out the weekend (after soaking up the sun and a few brews), this night of beach-vibe music could be the ticket.</p>\n<p>For those who haven&rsquo;t been to the Key West Theater, there isn&rsquo;t a bad seat in the house. The quaint theater was originally a First Baptist Church built in 1848, and has since been a dance club, concert venue and is now a non-profit performing arts center that provides an intimate setting.</p>\n<p><strong>When</strong>: Sept. 3.

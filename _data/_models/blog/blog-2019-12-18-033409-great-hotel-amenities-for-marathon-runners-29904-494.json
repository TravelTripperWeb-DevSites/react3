Plus, Key West is a one-of-a-kind destination, serving up a <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/best-cuban-food-key-west/\">culinary scene</a> with Bahaman and Cuban influence, brimming with <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/search/?query=history\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">history</a>, a raucous <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/duval-street/\">night life</a>, and its fair share of&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/keywest-florida-hemingway-house-cats/\">six-toed-cats.</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Florida Keys plays host to a <a href=\"https://www.gateshotelkeywest.com/blog/fl-keys-marathons-5k/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">handful</a> of marathons, so the hospitality business is no stranger to catering to runners, from pasta dinners the night before the race to after-party drink specials. Here are some amenities you&rsquo;ll want to consider before choosing the best hotel for your stay.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Quiet After-Hours</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There&rsquo;s no better way to prepare yourself for a race than a good night&rsquo;s sleep. You definitely won&rsquo;t want a rooster crowing at 3 am to mess that up. Research the hotel&rsquo;s location to judge whether it&rsquo;s a good fit for a&nbsp;restful slumber.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Pool</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whether you want to take a dip to relax or for <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/swimmers/health_benefits_water_exercise.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">low-impact</a> exercise, a hotel pool is a must for the marathon runner, both before and after an event.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Fitness room</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A fitness room helps an athlete maintain their workout regiment away from home, regardless of weather. Many hotels today offer fitness rooms with updated workout equipment.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Sidewalks</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Not one for running indoors on a treadmill? Head outside. You&rsquo;ll want a hotel that&rsquo;s well-connected to its surrounding area with accessible sidewalks. A good view is a plus.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">On-site food</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The best part of running may be the meal that comes after the workout. Make sure the hotel you choose has on-site options that are healthy, fresh, and not too heavy on the grease.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Heading to Key West for a marathon? <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/rooms/\">24 North Hotel</a> ticks all the boxes!

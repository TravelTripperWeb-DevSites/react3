But we&rsquo;re a resilient bunch here on the island and are cleaning up the mess and getting back on our feet. Yup! <a href=\"http://www.gainesville.com/news/20171004/scott-keys-open-for-business\">Key West is up and running</a> and we&rsquo;re shaking off the welcome mat for all our incoming visitors.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Events are all going on as planned. This year&rsquo;s Fantasy Fest is still on for Oct. 20-29, because it wouldn&rsquo;t be October in Key West without a parade of costumed or painted party-goers gracing our streets with their presence. The theme this year is Time Travel Unravels, and for costume tips, <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/costume-tips-for-fantasy-fest/\">check out our blog here</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The International Power Boat Races are&nbsp;set for Nov. 5-12, because November just wouldn&rsquo;t be the same without the buzzing sound of offshore power boats.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And did you hear? Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s is back open and the juice is flowing there. Duval Street is still Duval Street -- while it got a bit quiet and wet for a few days in September, it&rsquo;s back and kicking.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/weather/2017/09/11/hemingways-six-tied-cats-caretakers-survive-hurricane-irma-key-west\">News reports</a> also say that the Hemingway House is up and running, and all of the 6-toed cats that live on the premises survived just fine.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Southernmost Point Marker, a selfie-must on the island, got a pretty bad beating but will be restored.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Transit&rsquo;s back - the airport&rsquo;s open, Mallory Square is again welcoming cruise ships, and all the roads are open.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was a tough month for Key West, but everyone pulled together and we&rsquo;re back and open for business. The endless summer continues, and we invite you to enjoy sunny days with us, a nice cold rum runner and an appetite, because it&rsquo;s just about time for stone crab season.</p>",

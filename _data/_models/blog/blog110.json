Don&rsquo;t get stuck in the rain -- make the most of it! If you have some <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/rainy-day-in-key-west/\">rainy day backup plans</a> in your pocket, your island vacation won&rsquo;t take a backseat to crummy weather.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">See a movie at The Tropic Cinema</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The art-deco clad independent movie theater is a great place to step out of the rain and enjoy a movie. From Hollywood blockbusters to smaller, independent films, <a href=\"https://www.tropiccinema.com/\">The Tropic Cinema</a> is a favorite among locals. The concessions are tasty and include adult beverages, screening rooms are clean, and you leave with that quaint, small-town, pleasant feeling afterward. Films begin 10 minutes after scheduled time, so be punctual. 416 Eaton St.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Have a Drink and Play Games at Waterfront Brewery</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are endless excuses to have a drink in Key West, from high temperatures and intense sun rays to the absolute opposite. Who&rsquo;s to judge? Either way, <a href=\"http://www.thewaterfrontbrewery.com/\">The Waterfront Brewery</a> has the perfect playroom for adults 21+. The game room has pool tables, foosball and air hockey, all which can be more enjoyable with a nice cold one. 201 William St.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Take a Walk with the Butterflies</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The glass-domed <a href=\"https://www.keywestbutterfly.com/\">Key West Butterfly &amp; Nature Conservatory</a> makes for a dry walk in nature during rainy days. For a quiet escape, this magical facility houses an array of butterflies (especially the striking Blue Morphos), as well as two talkative flamingos. It&rsquo;s refreshing to walk into the sanctuary and see the butterflies dance around the lush gardens. It&rsquo;s hard to believe it&rsquo;s located on Duval Street - 1316 Duval St.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Go for a Trolley Ride</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It may seem a bit odd, but a trolley ride is a great way to beat the heat and get a nice scope of the island. With simple, unlimited hop-on and off privileges, the <a href=\"https://www.trolleytours.com/key-west#home-section\">Old Town Trolley</a> tour makes for a relaxed sightseeing experience that can be as serendipitous as you&rsquo;d like. Start at Mallory Square and hop off and explore whatever you&rsquo;d like to during the tour. Choose from museums, gardens, or take time to see Truman&rsquo;s Little White House. <a href=\"https://www.trolleytours.com/key-west/map\">More info here.</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p><em>Need some R &amp; R?

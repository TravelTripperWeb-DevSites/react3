First, it&rsquo;s the southernmost marathon in the continental states&nbsp;&ndash; hence the name. It starts with sunrise and covers multiple islands with gorgeous views of the Gulf of Mexico and the Florida Straits. Last, it weaves through the picturesque Old Town in Key West &ndash; a downtown characterized for its old-style Florida homes, <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/ernest-hemingway/\">history,</a> and lively nightlife.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The flat course begins and ends at <a href=\"https://lagerheadsbeachbar.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lagerheads Beach Bar</a> (0 Simonton St.) after heading north to Stock Island and Boca Chica and Rockland keys along the Overseas Highway (Route 1). Runners can expect endless views of the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico while on Route 1, which connects the Florida Keys.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For runners who can&rsquo;t quite make a full or half marathon, there is a 5k course available for participants. The course spans from the designated spot at 0 Simonton Street and heads to <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/fort-zachary/\">Ft. Zachary Taylor State Park</a>, before turning around.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re vacationing in Key West that weekend, the event shouldn&rsquo;t hinder any of your plans, with the full marathon beginning at 5:30 am.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Entry fees start at $35 for the 5k; $99 for the half marathon, and $130 for the full marathon. Proceeds benefit <a href=\"http://www.habitatlowerkeys.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Habitat for Humanity</a> of Key West and the Lower Florida Keys.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Join us in Key West for the Southernmost Marathon!&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">24 North Hotel is located along the route at 3820 N.

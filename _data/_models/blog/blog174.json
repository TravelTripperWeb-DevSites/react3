Aside from being home to <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/a-look-at-the-florida-coral-reef/\">one of the largest natural coral reefs on the planet</a>, it also has shipwrecks &ndash; both real and artificial &ndash; to explore.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Its prized artificial reef grows from the USNS Vandenberg, a missile tracking ship built during WWII. It was intentionally sunk seven miles off the coast of Key West in 2009.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1553541462107\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1553541457/n6xsvzt8cssawxmalm3s.jpg\" alt=\"vandenberg-dive-key-west-fish\" width=\"551\" height=\"735\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1553541457/n6xsvzt8cssawxmalm3s.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1553541457/n6xsvzt8cssawxmalm3s.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1553541457/n6xsvzt8cssawxmalm3s.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1553541457/n6xsvzt8cssawxmalm3s.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1553541457/n6xsvzt8cssawxmalm3s.jpg\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The 523-foot-long Vandenberg was built in 1943 and acquired by the US Navy the following year. It was used for primarily cargo transportation purposes. During the Cold War, the ship was used by the US Air Force as a designated missile range instrumentation ship, tracking and analyzing ballistic missile test flights and spacecrafts in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Today, the massive vessel rests on the seafloor 150 feet underwater. It stands 10 stories high and is the length of two football fields. Algae and sea life have already staked their claim on the ship, and future generations will likely see the ship blooming with sponges and diverse coral species.</p>\n<p>The ship is said to be the second-largest vessel to be intentionally sunk for the purposes of diving and helps to ease human traffic on surrounding reefs. For a more in-depth look of the ship and video of its sinking, check out Sinking the Vandenberg on <a href=\"https://fla-keys.com/diving/vandenberg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fla-Keys.org.</a></p>\n<p>Finally, how to dive the wreck.</p>\n<p><img id=\"1553541619528\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1553541612/vgeu8yv1dpwzqb2owxno.jpg\" alt=\"vandenberg-dive-flag-key-west\" width=\"601\" height=\"450\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1553541612/vgeu8yv1dpwzqb2owxno.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1553541612/vgeu8yv1dpwzqb2owxno.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1553541612/vgeu8yv1dpwzqb2owxno.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1553541612/vgeu8yv1dpwzqb2owxno.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1553541612/vgeu8yv1dpwzqb2owxno.jpg\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At a depth of 150 feet, exploring the Vandenberg is for experienced divers. The boat trip to the site takes roughly 45 minutes, and conditions can vary. Currents can be strong and visibility murky, though clear, crystal-blue conditions are also a possibility.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We recommend booking a guide with Lost Reef Adventures.

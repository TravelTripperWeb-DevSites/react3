  "more_content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Fantasy Fest is just about upon us, but it&rsquo;s hard to be totally prepared for the island&rsquo;s party of the year. Here are 5 helpful tips to surviving <a href=\"http://www.fantasyfest.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fantasy Fest</a>, which celebrates another year in Key West this October.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">1. Travel light</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For Fantasy Fest, you basically need cash, ID and a camera. Ensuring that these things are safeguarded but easily accessible will make Fantasy Fest more enjoyable for you. Don&rsquo;t bring a backpack or anything bulky &ndash; backpacks aren't allowed in the Fantasy Zone and anything bulky will only weigh you down. Fantasy Fest brings out all kinds of costumes, or lack thereof &ndash; just make sure you have a secure place where you can access your ID quickly, cash and camera for a quick photo. Lines are long, so be prepared!</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">2. Don&rsquo;t bring a car</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Don&rsquo;t bother. Parking will be a nightmare you just won&rsquo;t want to worry about. Call a cab or use any available shuttle or public transit service. This way you and your entourage don&rsquo;t need to pick a DD and you don&rsquo;t have to worry about remembering where you parked the car.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">3. Ask before taking a photo</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A lot of people come to <a href=\"http://www.fantasyfest.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fantasy Fest </a>in their birthday suits, but they don&rsquo;t necessarily want to share it with the world. Ask before taking a photo. Likewise, if this is an issue for you, opt for a mask. They have a great selection at <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fairvilla+Megastore/@28.5667937,-81.4027944,21z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x88e77a6baa6b63f9:0xb6da27344c226aff!8m2!3d28.5667809!4d-81.4028158?hl=en\">Fairvilla</a>.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">4. Be sweet to your feet</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There&rsquo;s more walking and standing at <a href=\"http://www.fantasyfest.com/\">Fantasy Fest</a> than the contrary. Keep the old dogs happy and wear the right shoes. Flip flops don&rsquo;t really cut it in crowds. Wear breathable shoes and good socks. No one wants a FF blister.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">5. Don&rsquo;t be &ldquo;that&rdquo; person</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Don't throw cast away your&nbsp;common sense during Fantasy Fest. Remember, the island is home to many, and while Key West isn&rsquo;t Key West without Fantasy Fest, it&rsquo;s important that everyone respects the host (which is the island and its locals). Keep all open containers within the designated Fantasy Zone, don&rsquo;t litter, stay hydrated, be smart and have fun!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hurry up! Rooms&nbsp;go fast leading up to Fantasy Fest. Book with <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/rooms/\">24 North Hotel</a> for a seamless trip to Key West.</p>",

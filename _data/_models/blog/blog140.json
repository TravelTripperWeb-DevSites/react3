  "more_content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Capt. Tony is as much of a legend in Key West as his namesake saloon on Greene Street, which he opened in 1958. Known for his delightful storytelling, friendliness, and propensity to curse like a sailor, Capt. Tony &ndash; former mayor of Key West, bootlegger, fisherman, sailor, gambler, bar owner and father of 13 &ndash; was a Key West personality whose spirit has left an impression on the island.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">New Jersey native, Tony Tarracino found his way to Key West by accident (as most do) in the late 1940s after years of living the life of a gambler. While in the Garden State, Tony illegally produced and smuggled whiskey for money. Aside from running whiskey, he also ran a horse racing scheme with his brother. Eventually the mob caught up with Tony and delivered a proper beating. Tony took off and headed south. After hitching a ride aboard a milk truck, he found his way onto <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/duval-street/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Duval Street.</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I knew as soon as I got off that milk truck that Key West didn&rsquo;t belong to the United States,&rdquo; Tony said in A Key West Companion, a book&nbsp;written by Christopher Cox.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After 10 years working as a charter boat captain and fisherman, Tony bought &ldquo;Florida&rsquo;s Oldest Bar&rdquo; on Greene Street, also the original Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s. He opened and ran <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/key-weird-series-capt-tonys/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Capt. Tony&rsquo;s Saloon</a> from 1958 until 1989. Today, the dive bar that retains its name is an oft-visited watering hole for tourists, drawn to <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/key-weird-series-capt-tonys/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the bar&rsquo;s wacky history</a> and famous &ldquo;hanging tree&rdquo; &ndash; stories which may or may not be entirely true.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tony sold the bar in 1989 when he was elected mayor of Key West. According to a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/15/AR2008111502324.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Washington Post obituary</a>, Tony&rsquo;s platform was to preserve Key West as &ldquo;a refuge for eccentrics and renegades.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Key West is an insane asylum. We're just too lazy to put up the walls or fences,\" he famously said. He said a lot of other things that we&rsquo;ll leave you to find.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mayor, Tony helped to preserve Key West&rsquo;s daily sunset celebration, which continues in <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/mallory-square/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mallory Square</a> to this day.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He captivated so many folks on the island that he was referred to in the Chicago Sun-Times as, &ldquo;arguably the city's most beloved resident.\" He has been extensively written about, from books to newspapers. Jimmy Buffett mentions Capt. Tony in his song &ldquo;Last Mango in Paris.&rdquo; He is also portrayed by Stuart Whitman in the 1980 film, &ldquo;Cuba Crossing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Want to learn more about Capt. Tony?

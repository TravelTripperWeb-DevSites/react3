Here are some ideas to enjoy a slow-moving Sunday in the Conch Republic.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Catch brunch at First Flight</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What better way to start a lazy Sunday than by eating your first meal at a vague hour? There&rsquo;s no rush and you never run late. We suggest brunch at <a href=\"http://firstflightkw.com/brunch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">First Flight</a> in Old Town, located a block down from the <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/mel-fisher-maritime-heritage-museum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mel Fisher Museum</a> <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/LgdRRfwE3G62\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(see map)</a>. Brunch runs 10-2 at this laid-back spot with agreeable outdoor seating under the trees. A variety of eggs benedict, a pancake bar and bottomless mimosas will hit the spot.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Hail a pedicab</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Take a ride up or down (and back up around) Duval Street via pedicab. Feel the wind in your hair and give your feet a rest. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/southernmost-point-buoy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Southernmost Point</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/key-west-butterfly-and-nature-conservatory/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Butterfly Conservatory</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/key-west-lighthouse-museum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Key West Lighthouse</a>, or just enjoy a ride-around.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Spend the day at the pool</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The obvious option for a lazy Sunday is to hang out at the hotel &ndash; and at 24 North, that&rsquo;s a perfectly comfortable way to spend the day. Relax by the pool, get fresh fare from <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/dine-drink/toasted-coconut/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Toasted Coconut</a> (or the nearby Blind Pig food truck), enjoy a mojito from the Republica Bar &amp; Lounge located in the lobby, and watch the day go by.</p>\n<h3>Beach day at Smathers</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Do some reading, catch some sun rays or snorkel around Smathers Beach to while away your Sunday. <a href=\"http://www.sunsetwatersportskeywest.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sunset Watersports</a> rents out beach chairs and umbrellas if you want to set up your perfect spot for lounging. Smathers is the largest public beach on the island, beginning at the zero-mile marker and stretching along <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/three-reasons-to-stay-in-new-town-key-west/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New Town</a> (roughly 3 miles from <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/rooms/\">24 North Hotel</a>).</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">See a Movie at Tropic Cinema</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tropic Cinema is an independent movie theater that plays blockbusters, independent films and cinema classics. Make a night of it at this nostalgic theater with art deco themes. Stop by the snackbar &ndash; the fare is better than what you find in any chain movie theater. <a href=\"https://www.tropiccinema.com/movie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See movie schedule.</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Does the current forecast have you thinking of bluer skies?

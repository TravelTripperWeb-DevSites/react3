There are endless activities you can enjoy that keep toddlers happy and stimulated.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are five things to do with little ones that you&rsquo;ll enjoy, too.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">1. Climb Aboard the Conch Train</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Conch Train may sound like kid stuff, but it&rsquo;s actually a great way for you to get a grasp on your surroundings. Scope out places you&rsquo;ll want to visit during the rest of your trip and learn about Key West history. The tour runs through Old Town, passing the <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/ernest-hemingway/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hemingway Home and Museum</a>, the Mel Fisher Museum, and dozens of other special interest sites. Best of all, you can hop on or off whenever you&rsquo;d like. Did we mention that kids absolutely love it? Explore your whereabouts in the fresh open air! Save by buying tickets online at the <a href=\"https://www.conchtourtrain.com/key-west-tickets.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Conch Train website.</a></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">2. Visit the Key West Butterfly and Nature Conservatory</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The leafy habitat enclosed by glass houses over 50 different species of butterflies, colorful flowers, and two chatty flamingos. The conservatory has a mostly calming effect on toddlers, as they surely haven&rsquo;t seen so many butterflies in one place at a time. Open 9 am to 5:30 daily. <a href=\"https://www.keywestbutterfly.com/\">See website for details.</a></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">3. Make Sandcastles at the Beach</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rug rats like to get messy, and the beach is one of the best places for it. Let your toddler build their own version of sandcastles and explore their surroundings at the beach. We recommend <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/top-beaches-key-west-best/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Smathers Beach</a>, located on the south side of the island. It&rsquo;s one of the only beaches in Key West that&rsquo;s sandy instead of rocky, and you can rent beach gear and umbrellas to ensure that no one goes home with a sunburn.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">4. Sunset Celebration at Mallory Square</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The sunset celebration at Mallory Square is a hodgepodge of street performers, live music, food vendors, and tourists awaiting the view of the setting sun. Bring your toddler to Mallory Square to take in the scene and watch the sunset with the community. Also, keep an eye out for the green flash! <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/key-weird-sunsets-green-flash/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read more about the unique phenomena here.</a></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">5. Explore the Ocean on a Glass Bottom Boat</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You and your little one can marvel at the coral reef, stingrays, sea turtles, and other marine life aboard a glass bottom boat! Our friends at Fury Water Adventures offers a two-hour tour that departs three times a day. The boat includes an air-conditioned cabin for underwater viewing, a sundeck, snackbar, and excellent guides. You and your family will be comfortable during this trip, and if toddlers need to relax amidst all the action, they can sit and cool off in the air-conditioned cabin. <a href=\"https://www.furycat.com/key-west/glass-bottom-boats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Book ahead with Fury Water Adventures.</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p>Traveling to Key West? 24 North Hotel has a beautiful pool, an onsite restaurant, Starbucks, and hourly shuttle service to Old Town.

  "more_content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The Key West Theater today has never looked better &mdash; after extensive renovations after years of sitting dormant, the building opened its doors in 2015 as a non-profit performing arts center. Today it draws international acts to its 255-seat space, offering entertainment to locals and tourists.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And like all things Key West, the island town&rsquo;s theater has an unique past. The theater wasn&rsquo;t always a theater &mdash; just look at the steeple. It was originally the First Baptist Church of Key West, built in 1848.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here&rsquo;s where it gets Key West Weird: local rumors passed down through generations say that the pastor&rsquo;s wife was having an affair with the church deacon, and that everyone in town knew. After 6 quiet and pious months, the pastor allegedly arrived with kerosene and set it on fire, with his wife and local children inside. For this reason, the building was a hot spot for ghost hunting tours, where tourists would snap photos in hopes of capturing an orb.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1508177824765\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/359_384_8362/media/2017-10-16-141658/key-west-theater.jpg\" width=\"966\" height=\"732\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/359_384_8362/media/2017-10-16-141658/large_key-west-theater.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/359_384_8362/media/2017-10-16-141658/medium_key-west-theater.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/359_384_8362/media/2017-10-16-141658/small_key-west-theater.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/359_384_8362/media/2017-10-16-141658/xsmall_key-west-theater.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/359_384_8362/media/2017-10-16-141658/thumb_key-west-theater.jpg\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It later went on to be a dancehall, club and concert hall. Before it returned to its splendor as Key West Theater it was called Club Chameleon, and was painted a soft pink with turquoise accents. It sat abandoned for years before reopening as a performing arts center in 2015. Again, local rumors attributed its dormancy to the presence of ghosts and workers&rsquo; fear of being in the building. But it&rsquo;s all hearsay.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you&rsquo;re planning a trip with us, we encourage you to check out the theater&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.thekeywesttheater.com/calendar/\">calendar</a> here.

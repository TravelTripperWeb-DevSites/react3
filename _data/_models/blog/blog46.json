Biker bars are part of the fabric of Key West, so here&rsquo;s a few you ought to check out after the long journey to the last island.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.schoonerwharf.com/\">Schooner Wharf Bar&nbsp;</a></h3>\n<p>This laid-back bar offers waterfront views, live music and ridiculously good food. After a day on the road, this is a nice spot to sit up on the deck and enjoy looking out into the marina. It has full-on dive bar/biker bar vibes; great spot for those traveling by land or sea. Full bar, fair prices. Happy breakfast hour runs 7 a.m. to noon. Yep, you read right. <em>202 Williams Street</em></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.halfshellrawbar.com/raw-bar\">Half Shell Raw Bar</a></h3>\n<p>Half Shell Raw Bar is a great place to grab a beer. Happy hour runs 4:30-6:30 with good deals on raw oysters and other small bites. It&rsquo;s an outside place with full bar and picnic tables and no AC -- so it&rsquo;s pretty hot during summer days. Grab a seat at the bar and enjoy a cold one. <em>231 Margaret Street</em></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.tattoosandscarssaloon.com/\">Tattoos &amp; Scars Saloon</a></h3>\n<p>This local watering hole has an entire motorcycle hanging from the ceiling, as if to say, &ldquo;Bikers welcome!&rdquo; The bar stools are comfortable which is necessary after a long ride, the music&rsquo;s loud and the place has plenty of seats. Make sure you eat before you get to the saloon -- for dinner and lunch fare they offer peanuts. Open til 4 a.m. <em>512 Greene Street</em></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.greenparrot.com/\">Green Parrot Bar</a></h3>\n<p>The Green Parrot bar is a Key West institution.The building was a grocery store back in 1890, and after the Great Depression it became a place for a drink. It&rsquo;s been home to divorce celebrations, tattoo contests and regular old birthday parties. You can&rsquo;t visit Key West and not stop by The Parrot. Open 10 a.m. to 4 a.m. <em>601 Whitehead Street</em></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p><em>Ready to book a spot with us?

They make for a quick-fire way to check out the surrounding waters of Key West. Not sure what the rules are in Florida for renting personal watercraft (PWC)? Let us be your guide.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Age requirements</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You must be 18 or older to rent a PWC, though age requirements differ when it comes to driving one. Children as young as 14 are permitted to operate a PWC, but most rental companies require that the child is accompanied by an adult.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Boating License / Certifications</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You DO need a boating license or at least a temporary boating certification to operate any personal watercraft.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Florida residents:&nbsp;</strong>Florida law requires anyone who was born on or after Jan. 1, 1988, to successfully complete <a href=\"https://myfwc.com/boating/safety-education/courses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an approved boating safety course</a> and obtain a Boating Safety Education Identification Card issued by the FWC. Courses can be taken online <a href=\"https://www.boat-ed.com/floridarental/?tap_a=20415-39769e&amp;tap_s=142388-2852b6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here.<br /></a><strong>Out-of-state visitors:</strong> If you have proof that you&rsquo;ve successfully completed a boater safety course or an equivalent exam that meets or exceeds Florida's requirements, you do not need to have a Florida Boating Safety Education Identification Card, according to the FWC.<br /><strong>Temporary boating certificate:</strong> Many watersport vendors you&rsquo;ll be dealing with offer a temporary boating certificate which can be acquired before rental. The license is good for a year and the open-book exam is typically offered an hour before your rental.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Respecting Wildlife &amp; Fellow Boaters</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://myfwc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission</a> has some helpful tips for boaters, especially for those who aren&rsquo;t familiar with the habitats of the Florida waters. Here are some highlights:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>&gt;</strong>Stay in deep-water channels whenever possible<br /><strong>&gt;</strong>Wear polarized sunglasses to reduce glare on the surface of the water so you can see and avoid marine life<br /><strong>&gt;</strong>Avoid boating over <a href=\"https://myfwc.com/wildlifehabitats/wildlife/manatee/habitat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">seagrass</a> beds and shallow areas. Manatees are often found in shallow, slow-moving rivers, estuaries, lagoons, and coastal areas.<br /><a href=\"https://myfwc.com/education/wildlife/manatee/for-boaters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read the complete list here.</a></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Popular Excursions</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An exciting excursion in Key West is a 1.5-hour tour around the island. The approximate 26-mile tour is fast-paced and can get a little rough depending on the conditions. Not recommended for the faint-hearted! <a href=\"https://www.furycat.com/key-west/jet-ski\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See options with Fury Water Adventures.</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The best way to see Key West is on the water.

At Smathers Beach, you can rent snorkel gear from Sunset Watersports on the beach to explore a quiet, underwater world. <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/location/attractions/fort-zachary/\">Fort Zachary Taylor</a> is another favored snorkeling spot that&rsquo;s located on the west end of the island.
